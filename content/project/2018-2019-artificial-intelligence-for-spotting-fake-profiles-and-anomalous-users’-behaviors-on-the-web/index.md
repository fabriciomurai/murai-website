  Anomalous Usersâ€™ Behaviors on the Web"

  The key role of the web in our society requires mechanisms to guarantee its legitimate. Such mechanisms demand novel methodologies to cope with complex and multi-dimensional big data, for which ground truth is inherently lacking. We will build models that combine information from multiple sources (e.g., online social networks and network measurements) to uncover fake profiles and suspicious activities, enhancing the legitimate use of the web.

The key role of the web in our society requires mechanisms to guarantee its legitimate use. Fake profiles and malicious users threat the well-working of the web. We witness the spread of fake content on social networks, disseminated at large scale to bias users' perceptions, with impacts on reputations, businesses and even on elections. Equally, infected devices are often part of botnets disrupting services and spreading malicious content. Solving these problems requires novel methodologies to cope with complex and multi-dimensional big data, for which ground truth is inherently lacking. Novel machine learning algorithms, such as deep neural networks, have been shown to operate well in problems facing similar challenges and, thus, are good candidates for the detection of abnormal profiles and behaviors. Our goal is to develop new models based on machine learning to describe the expected traffic and the behaviors of both users and devices. We will build models that combine information from multiple sources (e.g., online social networks and network measurements). The models will help to uncover fake profiles and suspicious activities, enhancing the legitimate use of the web.
