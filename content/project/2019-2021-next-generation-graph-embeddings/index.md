summary: _A research collaboration with Prof. Bruno Ribeiro (Purdue University)
  sponsored by CAPES/PrInt._ Deep learning has recently made great strides in
  solving increasingly complex tasks by simply mapping vector inputs to desired
  outputs. Still, the fundamental problem of building neural networks that can
  account for pre-defined input invariances of these vectors remains largely
  open.
