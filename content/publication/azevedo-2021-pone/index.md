abstract: "Scientific knowledge cannot be seen as a set of isolated fields, but as\
  \ a highly connected network. Understanding how research areas are connected is\
  \ of paramount importance for adequately allocating funding and human resources\
  \ (e.g., assembling teams to tackle multidisciplinary problems). The relationship\
  \ between disciplines can be drawn from data on the trajectory of individual scientists,\
  \ as researchers often make contributions in a small set of interrelated areas.\
  \ Two recent works propose methods for creating research maps from scientists' publication\
  \ records: by using a frequentist approach to create a transition probability matrix;\
  \ and by learning embeddings (vector representations). Surprisingly, these models\
  \ were evaluated on different datasets and have never been compared in the literature.\
  \ In this work, we compare both models in a systematic way, using a large dataset\
  \ of publication records from Brazilian researchers. We evaluate these models' ability\
  \ to predict whether a given entity (scientist, institution or region) will enter\
  \ a new field w.r.t. the area under the ROC curve. Moreover, we analyze how sensitive\
  \ each method is to the number of publications and the number of fields associated\
  \ to one entity. Last, we conduct a case study to showcase how these models can\
  \ be used to characterize science dynamics in the context of Brazil."
