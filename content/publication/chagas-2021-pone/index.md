abstract: This article proposes a study of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread and the efficacy
  of public policies in Brazil. Using both aggregated (from large Internet companies)
  and fine-grained (from Departments of Motor Vehicles) mobility data sources, our
  work sheds light on the effect of mobility on the pandemic situation in the Brazilian
  territory. Our main contribution is to show how mobility data, particularly fine-grained
  ones, can offer valuable insights into virus propagation. For this, we propose a
  modification in the SENUR model to add mobility information, evaluating different
  data availability scenarios (different information granularities), and finally,
  we carry out simulations to evaluate possible public policies. In particular, we
  conduct a case study that shows, through simulations of hypothetical scenarios,
  that the contagion curve in several Brazilian cities could have been milder if the
  government had imposed mobility restrictions soon after reporting the first case.
  Our results also show that if the government had not taken any action and the only
  safety measure taken was the population's voluntary isolation (out of fear), the
  time until the contagion peak for the first wave would have been postponed, but
  its value would more than double.
