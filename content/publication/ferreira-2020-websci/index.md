abstract: "Online Social Networks (OSNs) allow users to generate and consume content\
  \ in an easy and personalized way. Among OSNs, Instagram has seen a surge in popularity,\
  \ and political actors exploit it to reach people at scale, bypassing traditional\
  \ media and often triggering harsh debates with and among followers. Uncovering\
  \ the structural properties and dynamics of such interactions is paramount for understanding\
  \ the online political debate. This is a challenging task due to both the size of\
  \ the network and the nature of interactions. In this paper, we define a probabilistic\
  \ model to extract the backbone of the interaction network among Instagram commenters\
  \ and, after that, we uncover communities. We apply our model to 10 weeks of comments\
  \ centered around election times in Brazil and Italy. We monitor both politicians\
  \ and other categories of influencers, finding persistent commenters, i.e., those\
  \ who often comment together on Instagram posts. Our methodology allows us to unveil\
  \ interesting facts: i) commenters' networks are split into few communities; ii)\
  \ community structure in politics is weaker than in general profiles, indicating\
  \ that the political debate is a blur, with some commenters bridging strongly opposed\
  \ political actors; and iii) communities engaging on political profiles are bigger,\
  \ more active and more stable during electoral period."
