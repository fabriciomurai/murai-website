 abstract = {Instagram has been increasingly used as a source of information especially among the youth. As a result, political figures now leverage the platform to spread opinions and political agenda. We here analyze online discussions on Instagram, notably in political topics, from a network perspective. Specifically, we investigate the emergence of communities of co-commenters, that is, groups of users who often interact by commenting on the same posts and may be driving the ongoing online discussions. In particular, we are interested in salient co-interactions, i.e., interactions of co-commenters that occur more often than expected by chance and under independent behavior. Unlike casual and accidental co-interactions which normally happen in large volumes, salient co-interactions are key elements driving the online discussions and, ultimately, the information dissemination. We base our study on the analysis of 10 weeks of data centered around major elections in Brazil and Italy, following both politicians and other celebrities. We extract and characterize the communities of co-commenters in terms of topological structure, properties of the discussions carried out by community members, and how some community properties, notably community membership and topics, evolve over time. We show that communities discussing political topics tend to be more engaged in the debate by writing longer comments, using more emojis, hashtags and negative words than in other subjects. Also, communities built around political discussions tend to be more dynamic, although top commenters remain active and preserve community membership over time. Moreover, we observe a great diversity in discussed topics over time: whereas some topics attract attention only momentarily, others, centered around more fundamental political discussions, remain consistently active over time.},
