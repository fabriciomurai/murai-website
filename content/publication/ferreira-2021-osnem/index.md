abstract: 'Instagram has been increasingly used as a source of information especially
  among the youth. As a result, political figures now leverage the platform to spread
  opinions and political agenda. We here analyze online discussions on Instagram,
  notably in political topics, from a network perspective. Specifically, we investigate
  the emergence of communities of co-commenters, that is, groups of users who often
  interact by commenting on the same posts and may be driving the ongoing online discussions.
  In particular, we are interested in salient co-interactions, i.e., interactions
  of co-commenters that occur more often than expected by chance and under independent
  behavior. Unlike casual and accidental co-interactions which normally happen in
  large volumes, salient co-interactions are key elements driving the online discussions
  and, ultimately, the information dissemination. We base our study on the analysis
  of 10 weeks of data centered around major elections in Brazil and Italy, following
  both politicians and other celebrities. We extract and characterize the communities
  of co-commenters in terms of topological structure, properties of the discussions
  carried out by community members, and how some community properties, notably community
  membership and topics, evolve over time. We show that communities discussing political
  topics tend to be more engaged in the debate by writing longer comments, using more
  emojis, hashtags and negative words than in other subjects. Also, communities built
  around political discussions tend to be more dynamic, although top commenters remain
  active and preserve community membership over time. Moreover, we observe a great
  diversity in discussed topics over time: whereas some topics attract attention only
  momentarily, others, centered around more fundamental political discussions, remain
  consistently active over time.'
