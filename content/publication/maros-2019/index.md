abstract: "Â© 2019 IEEE. Big data applications and analytics are employed in many sectors\
  \ for a variety of goals: improving customers satisfaction, predicting market behavior\
  \ or improving processes in public health. These applications consist of complex\
  \ software stacks that are often run on cloud systems. Predicting execution times\
  \ is important for estimating the cost of cloud services and for effectively managing\
  \ the underlying resources at runtime. Machine Learning (ML), providing black box\
  \ solutions to model the relationship between application performance and system\
  \ configuration without requiring in-detail knowledge of the system, has become\
  \ a popular way of predicting the performance of big data applications. We investigate\
  \ the cost-benefits of using supervised ML models for predicting the performance\
  \ of applications on Spark, one of today's most widely used frameworks for big data\
  \ analysis. We compare our approach with Ernest (an ML-based technique proposed\
  \ in the literature by the Spark inventors) on a range of scenarios, application\
  \ workloads, and cloud system configurations. Our experiments show that Ernest can\
  \ accurately estimate the performance of very regular applications, but it fails\
  \ when applications exhibit more irregular patterns and/or when extrapolating on\
  \ bigger data set sizes. Results show that our models match or exceed Ernest's performance,\
  \ sometimes enabling us to reduce the prediction error from 126-187% to only 5-19%."
