abstract: A large body of recent works has focused on understanding and detecting
  fake news stories that are disseminated on social media. To accomplish this goal,
  these works explore several types of features extracted from news stories, including
  source and posts from social media. In addition to exploring the main features proposed
  in the literature for fake news detection, we present a new set of features and
  measure the prediction performance of current approaches and features for automatic
  detection of fake news. Our results reveal interesting findings on the usefulness
  and importance of features for detecting false news. Finally, we discuss how fake
  news detection approaches can be used in the practice, highlighting challenges and
  opportunities.
