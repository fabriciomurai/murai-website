abstract: 'Online Social Networks (OSNs) allow personalities and companies to communicate
  directly with the public, bypassing filters of traditional medias. As people rely
  on OSNs to stay up-to-date, the political debate has moved online too. We witness
  the sudden explosion of harsh political debates and the dissemination of rumours
  in OSNs. Identifying such behaviour requires a deep understaning on how people interact
  via OSNs during political debates. We present a preliminary study of interactions
  in a popular OSN, namely Instagram. We take Italy as a case study in the period
  before the 2019 European Elections. We observe the activity of top Italian Instagram
  profiles in different categories: politics, music, sport and show. We record their
  posts for more than two months, tracking “likes” and comments from users. Results
  suggest that profiles of politicians attract markedly different interactions than
  other categories. People tend to comment more, with longer comments, debating for
  longer time, with a large number of replies, most of which are not explicitly solicited.
  Moreover, comments tend to come from a small group of very active users. Finally,
  we witness substantial differences when comparing profiles of different parties.'
